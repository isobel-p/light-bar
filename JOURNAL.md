# May 23 - Idea
Today I got the inspiration to finally start my light bar project and planned out a rough roadmap for how I want this project to go. I'm making this alongside exams so I'll probably complete it over multiple days in small sessions.

The PCB shouldn't be too complex. I wanted RGB neopixels in series because I kinda know how to use them and they shouldn't be too expensive. To customise the colours and power the whole thing I'll probably use the SEEED Xiao RP2040 because it's small enough to fit on a light bar and it's cheap enough so HC will probably sponsor it. My project also doesn't need a lot of GPIO pins so I can go for something a little smaller than a Pico.

I was inspired by this [Xiaomi Computer Monitor Light Bar](https://www.mi.com/uk/product/mi-computer-monitor-light-bar/). The case will be a minimal form factor enclosure to hold the whole thing. The container needs to diffuse the light while also being able to grip onto my monitor. The case will probably be the hardest bit - I'm pretty new to CAD so it might end up looking like a box but I plan to learn something new by making this. I also don't have a 3D printer, which might make it harder to print tests.

I did Hackpad v2 (just before Highway) but ironically didn't use neopixels in my macropad, one of my many regrets. Because of that amazing experience I have some familiarity with KMK firmware, which I'll probably use for this project. I'll have a better understanding of what I'll use in terms of coding once I finish the PCB.

(no pictures today, all in my head for now)

Today I just made the repo, planned out my idea and wrote up this journal post. All this took much longer than expected, because I made a few revisions to the idea before I wrote it up. Next time I'll start making the PCB! I also need to start writing the README, but I'll make the PCB first.

**Time spent this session: 2hrs**
